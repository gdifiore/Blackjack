Splitting logic
    - must be able to split current hand
    - money left must be >= bet (because double down)
    - if those conditions are true,
        - set a left and right hand (move card placement on board)
        - take cards for left side
            - print left score to left side
        - take cards for right side
            - print right score to right side
        - set which hands won
    - return which hands won (instead of calculating in main loop)
    - REDO winner calculation in main loop
